## Introduction

I am Jiaqi Ye, and I am a grade-three student in software school of SYSU. I have great passion for software development.
C++ is my favourite because I think it's a difficult language. And I am now trying to figure out the kernel of linux.
Also, I am interested in Modern Web technology and have an OJ(online judge system) which is built by my self running on a server in our school.
